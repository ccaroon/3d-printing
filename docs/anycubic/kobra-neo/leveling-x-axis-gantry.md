## Steps
1.







### Random
Level the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed itself (no matter if you already
trammed the bed by manipulating the stock spacers or if you added silicone
spacers or springs which allow to tram the bed itself). To do so, place e.g.
two soupcans onto the sides of the bed, lower the gantry until it rests onto
them, loosen the two screws of each of the Y-shaped metal brackets where the
wheels are mounted to. Then adjust the position of the wheels to get them in
the correct position and retighten the screws. Then it should be parallel to
the bed.

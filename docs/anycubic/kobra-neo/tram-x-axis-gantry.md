    - Similiar to, but not exactly Kobra Neo

## Tools
* 2.5mm hex allen wrench
* 10mm open-ended wrench
* Two cans of equal height (veggies, fruit etc.)

## Steps
Modified/Simplified from https://1coderookie.github.io/KobraGoNeoInsights/hardware/axes/#tramming-the-x-axis-gantry

0. Unload the filament; it'll just get in the way.
1. Turn the printer off and let it cool down.
2. Raise the X-Axis Gantry/Arm to slighty above the height of the cans by manually turning the Z-Axis screw from the bottom.
3. Manually move the print head to the center of the X-Axis gantry.
    - When lowered, it will need to be between the two cans such that it will not be in the way.
4. From the front of the printer, place each can on the bed as far to each side as possible and slide under the X-Axis gantry.
    - At this point the cans should not be touching the gantry.
    - The back edge of the can should align with the back edge of the gantry.
    - You don't want the can to be to touching the print head or the granty wheels or any other part.
    - The gantry should be free to move down and only be touching the cans when doing so.
5. Manually lower the X-Axis gantry (using the Z-screw) until it just, barely touches one of the cans.
    - Will likely be the (From the Front of the Printer) the right-most edge of the right-most can.
6. Loosen the screws on the Y-brackets on each side of the printer using the 2.5mm hex wrench
    - Don't fully remove them, just loosen.
7. Ensure that the outer two wheels on each side are touching the track
    - If not, then move/wiggle the Y-bracket until they do touch the track
    - Also, try pressing the wheels towards the track
    - Now, if the inner wheel is NOT touching the track, use the 10mm open wrench on the inner wheel's accentric nut to it move toward the track
    - Once complete, all three wheels on each side should be touching the track, but not too tight against it.
8. Manually lower the X-Axis granty using the Z-screw until all parts of the gantry are sitting on the cans
    - Just barely. Don't force the gantry down.
    - Once it just barely rests on both cans, STOP!
9. From the back of the printer & starting on the left (Z-Screw) side, re-tighten all Y-bracket screws.
    - Slightly press down on the gantry on each side as you tighten the screws
    - Make sure the outer wheels are still touching the track
10. Manually raise the X-Axis granty and remove the cans.
11. Check that everything is secure..
    - No wiggle or give on either side of the X-Axis grantry arm.
12. Clean the build plate
13. Turn on the printer
14. Menu -> Move axis -> Home -> Home All
15. Reload filament
16. Auto-level and adjust Z-offset
17. Perform test print
